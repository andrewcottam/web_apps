/*THE FOLLOWING DECLARATIONS ARE HACKS TO SUPPORT HAVING MORE THAN ONE VECTOR TILE LAYER IN A MAP
Normally in the L.VectorGrid.Protobuf class SVG elements which have the 'pointer-events: auto' set at the element level which blocks any events triggering in the layers beneath (as the SVG elements are 256x256 in size)
If you set it to none in the SVG but visible in the PATH element then it works*/

svg {
	pointer-events: none !important;
}

path {
	pointer-events: visiblePainted !important;
}

/*to highlight path features as you hover over them*/

path:hover {
	stroke-opacity: 1;
	fill-opacity: 0.25;
